### Methodology

We follow the approach that has been presented by Andreas Hösl et al here:

The basic idea is that each generator needs to provide reserve capacity **symmetrically**.
That means it needs to be able to increase and decrease its output by the same amount in order to contribute to satisfy reserve requirements.
This ensures that generators need to operate at partial load in order to provide reserve capacity. 

The following modifications need to be added to the linopy model in a PyPsa Network:

- a new variable $p_{\text{reserve}}(g,t)$ that represents the reserve power provided by generator $g$ in time step $t$. 

- a constraint that ensures that for each time step $t$, the sum of all reserve power provided is greater or equal the required reserves.
  $$
  \forall t: \sum_{g} p_{\text{reserve}}(g,t) \geq \text{reserve\_requirement}
  $$

- a constraint to ensure that the reserve power a generator provides must be less or equal than the difference between its output $p$ and its nominal capacity $p_\text{nom}$, multiplied with a scalar coefficient $a$.
  This coefficient can have any value between 0 and 1 and represents the technical availability of a generator to provide balancing power. 
  $$
  \forall g, t: p_\text{reserve}(g, t) \leq a(g) p_\text{nom}(g) - p(g,t)
  $$

- a constraint  to ensure that the balancing power a generator provides must be less or equal than its actual output $p$, multiplied with a scalar coefficient $b$. 
  This coefficient can have any value between 0 and 1 and represents the technical availability of a generator to provide balancing power. 
  $$
  \forall g, t: p_\text{reserve}(g, t) \leq b(g) p(g,t)
  $$

The relationships between the variables $a$, $b$, $p_\text{nom}$, $p$, and $p_\text{reserve}$ are depicted in the following schematic graph.
